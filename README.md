Plain AES-128 implementation (Rijndael Algorithm) for embedded system based IoT module (Tested in Particle Photon).

This implementation use sensor data from BME280 environmental sensor for plaintext. Added lines for send ciphertext via UDP and TCP/IP (Particle device only). Although it's resulted fair performance and good value of Avalanche Effect, but it can't be used for securing real IoT system because its vulnerabilities of using default mode (ECB mode) that can be analyzed with Side Channel Attack. This code is just for simplicity and readability to explain how AES algorithm is.

## TCP/IP & UDP Lines
This lines is for TCP/IP and UDP function.

To define TCP/IP connection, you can change this line with your destination IP and port.
```
TCPClient client;

IPAddress tcpIP(192,168,43,113);
int tcpPort = 5050;
```

To define UDP connection, you can change this line.
```
UDP Udp;

IPAddress remoteIP(192,168,43,113);
int udpPort = 1337;
```

To send packet, you can use this line:
1. For TCP/IP
```
if (client.connected())
  {
    client.write(enc);
  }
```

2. For UDP
```
if (Udp.sendPacket(enc, sizeof(enc), remoteIP, udpPort) < 0)
  {
    Serial.printlnf("Error");
  }
```

Fore more line functions, you can explore in this reference:

## Test Results
### 1. AES Performance
This test purpose is to find throughput and Avalanche Effect of the algorithm implementation in the system. The test results was taken from 10 times encryption.

</p>
The time of encryption can be measured with the formula below:<br>
<!-- $$
time_{encryption} = time_{end} - time_{start}
$$ --> 

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=time_%7Bencryption%7D%20%3D%20time_%7Bend%7D%20-%20time_%7Bstart%7D"></div>

For the throughput can be measured with this formula below:
<!-- $$
throughput = \frac{size_{plaintext}\,{(bit)}}{t_{encryption}\,{(s)}}
$$ --> 

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=throughput%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bsize_%7Bplaintext%7D%5C%2C%7B(bit)%7D%7D%7Bt_%7Bencryption%7D%5C%2C%7B(s)%7D%7D"></div>

Notes:</br> 
X-axis is encryption time (microseconds)<br>
Y-Axis is troughput (bits/second)

### 2. Energy Consumption
This test purpose is to find how much energy used for one time encryption. The method used for this test is calculate Vshunt of the IoT modules such in the picture below.
<p align="center">
<img width="320" height="240" src="https://i.postimg.cc/QCWZ1B81/Screenshot-from-2021-02-22-09-42-57.png">
</p>

The value of energy consumption is measured in 12 miliseconds time interval using oscilloscope. The results is the average of power and energy consumed for encryption in time interval.

</P>
The power needed for one cycle encryption process (12 miliseconds) can be measured with the formula below:<br>
<!-- $$
P = V_{n}\,{I} = V_{supply} - V_{shunt}\, \left( \frac{V_{shunt}}{R_{shunt}} \right)
$$ --> 

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P%20%3D%20V_%7Bn%7D%5C%2C%7BI%7D%20%3D%20V_%7Bsupply%7D%20-%20V_%7Bshunt%7D%5C%2C%20%5Cleft(%20%5Cfrac%7BV_%7Bshunt%7D%7D%7BR_%7Bshunt%7D%7D%20%5Cright)"></div><br>

</P>
And the energy needed for one cycle encryption can be measured with the formula below:<br>
<!-- $$
E = P\,t
$$ --> 

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E%20%3D%20P%5C%2Ct"></div>

Notes:<br>
X-axis is conditition (encrypt/idle)<br>
Y-Axis is Energy consumption (milliJoules)
